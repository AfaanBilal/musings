It is so often that we find ourselves amidst a situation where we see no path ahead. No light at the end of a dark and gloomy tunnel. No silver linings around the ominous black clouds. It is in those times that our true strength and resolve is tested. 

Even though we may have suffered through such moments *many* times, we often forget that we have come through them. Every time we feel as if this **is** the end of the road. In those moments those of us who *persevere* are the ones who will come through. Not only come through, but come through *victorious*. 

And **that** is what really matters.

> Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.

We, as a people, are now at a point where perseverance is something that is no longer optional for us. We must persevere in the difficulties we face. Persevere in our struggle. Persevere in our quest. Persevere in believing that we can still achieve our aims. 

I hope, and I pray that we persevere in our path even when the perseverance done seems to have brought no fruit but only tears of blood. For we *shall* overcome. We **have** to believe that. Else, all is already lost.
