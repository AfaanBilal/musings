title: Actions and Consequences
---
It is said that as we go through our lives, we acquire something called as *experience*. 

In the simplest of terms, we may say that experience is nothing but the knowledge that all actions have consequences. This process of learning is often characterised by countless actions which are later counted as *mistakes*. Though one may repeat a *mistake*, but then as per **Paulo Coehlo**:

> A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.

That is to say, an action can be said of as a mistake if and only if the actor has no specific knowledge of the consequences, nor has any forethought about them. And so, when the mistake is once done, we become aware of the consequences and then every subsequent repetition becomes a *decision*.

It is very often that we do not take the time to think an action through before committing it, particularly regarding the actions committed by our tongues. An informal line comes to mind:

> Please connect your tongue to your brain before speaking.

And a general rule of thumb to avoid doing such mistakes with our tongues is to remember the golden words:

> Speak only when you are sure that your words are better than silence.

And we must know that silence in itself is a thing to behold.
