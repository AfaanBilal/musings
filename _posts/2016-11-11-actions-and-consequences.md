It is said that as we go through our lives, we acquire something called as *experience*. 

In the simplest of terms, we may say that experience is nothing but the knowledge that all actions have consequences. This process of learning is often characterised by countless actions which are later counted as *mistakes*. Though one may repeat a *mistake*, but then as per **Paulo Coehlo*:

> A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.
