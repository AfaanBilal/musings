title: Accept, Adapt, Act
---
It feels strange and yet good that humans are able to find the blue sparks of happiness even in these dark times of black fires. The best ability of the human race is the ability to adapt. 

Whenever we find ourselves in such situations, we do what we best know how to do: **Accept, Adapt, Act**. The three *A*s.

Even though this is true for all, yet the time from *realisation to acceptance* and from *acceptance to adaptation* and from *adaptation to acting* varies by a vast factor in even those who are, outwardly, almost alike. 

So the question remains: what causes this massive difference? Why do some of us accept the situation at but a glance and yet some take years together to accept the truth that has been laid bare before them?
